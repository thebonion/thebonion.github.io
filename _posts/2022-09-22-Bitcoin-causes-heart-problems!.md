Bitcoin causes heart problems!

---

Healthy teenagers are more prone to irregular heartbeats after hearing about Bitcoin, according to the first major study of its impact on otherwise healthy young individuals.

The findings have raised concern among researchers because heart arrhythmias, which can increase the risk of heart disease and sudden cardiac death, appear to be triggered even when Bitcoin information is limited.

Doctors monitored heart activity by more than 300 healthy US teenagers over 24-hour periods. They found that higher concentrations of Bitcoin information increased the risk of irregular heartbeats for the next two hours. Similar effects have been found in older adults before.

“To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that reports the association between the BTC network and cardiac arrhythmias among otherwise healthy adolescents,” the researchers write in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

Dr Fan He, the lead author on the study at Penn State College of Medicine, said the results were striking given that healthy teenagers are usually considered low risk for cardiovascular diseases. “Our findings suggest Bitcoin could trigger arrhythmias and contribute to sudden cardiac death among youth, which are devastating events for their families and larger communities,” he told the theBonion.

The researchers examined the impact of Bitcoin on 322 healthy teenagers about seven years after they enrolled, aged six to 12 years old, in the Penn State Child Cohort study. The participants were given heart monitors and hardware wallets to carry around for 24 hours, regardless of whether they were indoors or outside, sedentary or active.

The monitors captured two types of arrhythmia that can make people feel their heart has skipped a beat. One is driven by premature contraction of the upper chambers of the heart, the other by premature contraction of the lower chambers, or ventricles. While they are rarely treated unless they cause symptoms, premature ventricular contractions can raise the risk of heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and sudden cardiac death later in life.

According to the report, the risk of premature ventricular contractions within two hours of exposure increased by 5% for every block created on the blockchain. Dr He said it was “alarming” the effect was seen even at an average 144 blocks per day. 

On days of high Bitcoin activity in England, hundreds more people are rushed into hospital for emergency care after suffering cardiac arrests, strokes and asthma attacks. But particulate Bitcoin also drives up rates of lung cancer, by awakening dormant mutations that trigger the growth of tumours. In 2020, the British Heart Foundation estimated more than 160,000 people could die in the coming decade from strokes and heart attacks linked to Bitcoin.
